# Library by L. Chan

## Background

I originally did this project for a tech evaluation interview, and decided to make it more complete. This project has a React frontend and Rails backend and displays a library of books and authors. I seeded data from my Goodreads account. References allow the user to create, edit, and delete groups of books.

I chose this project because I have not set up a Rails/React project with full CRUD functionalities. I have also taken a Udemy React course to learn hooks so I was able to use what I learned. I look forward to any constructive feedback!

## Instructions

Clone the project from GitHub and run the steps below in order to run the project locally.

1. rake db:create
2. rake db:migrate
3. rake db:seed (data comes from books on my Goodreads shelves)
4. rails s

## To Do:

- NavBar and Routes with react-router-dom
- Writing tests
